Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()                             
{
    int aw;
    float t;
    cin>>aw;
    cin>>t;
    if(aw%5==0 && (t>=aw+0.5))
    {
        
       t=t-float(aw+0.5); 
       
           cout<<t;
    }
    else
    {
       cout<<t;
    }
    

    return 0;
}

The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a ,count=0;
    int b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    long long int c[a];
    
       for(int i=0;i<a;i++)
    {
        
       cin>>c[i];
       
          
    }
      for(int i=0;i<a;i++)
    {
       if(c[i]%b==0)
       count++;
    }
       cout<<count<<endl;

    return 0;
}
